# Tag Governance

Tagging is critical for searchability and categorization. This document outlines guidelines for managing tags within the system.

## Creating Tags

Tags should be concise and descriptive. Avoid creating near-duplicates or overly specific tags when a broader term would suffice.

## Merging and Aliasing

When multiple tags represent the same concept, moderators can merge them. Use aliases to point variant spellings or synonyms to a canonical tag.

## Reserved Tags

Some tags may be reserved for system use (e.g., `featured`, `nsfw`). Do not repurpose these without consulting the development team.
