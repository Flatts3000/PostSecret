# Moderation Guide

This guide outlines recommended practices for reviewing and publishing secrets through the PostSecret admin plugin.

## Review Queues

The admin plugin provides several queues:

- **Needs Review** – Newly ingested secrets awaiting moderation.
- **Low Confidence** – Items flagged by automated classifiers for uncertain content.
- **Flagged** – Items flagged by users or automated systems for potential issues.
- **Published** – Secrets that have been approved and are publicly visible.

## Review Process

1. Open the **Needs Review** queue and select an item.
2. Read the secret text and inspect the attached image.
3. Assign tags where appropriate.
4. If everything looks good, approve the item to move it to **Published**.
5. If the item is problematic, unpublish it or move it to **Flagged** for further review.

Always be respectful and mindful of the sensitive nature of anonymous secrets.
